  longDescription:
    'Execute shell commands on the host machine. Only available for self-hosted deployments with EXECUTE_COMMAND_ENABLED=true. Commands run in the default shell of the host OS.',
  bestPractices: `
  - Commands execute in the default shell of the host machine (bash, zsh, cmd, PowerShell).
  - Chain multiple commands with && to run them sequentially.
  - Use <blockName.output> syntax to reference outputs from other blocks.
  - Use {{ENV_VAR}} syntax to reference environment variables.
  - The working directory defaults to the server process directory if not specified.
  - A non-zero exit code is returned as data (exitCode > 0), not treated as a workflow error. Use a Condition block to branch on exitCode if needed.
  - Variable values from other blocks are interpolated directly into the command string. Avoid passing untrusted user input as block references to prevent shell injection.
